# Digital-alarm-clock
A digital alarm clock made during the WEJAPA Internship wiith html, css and javascript

This project was designed to function and work as an alarm clock so this were the steps i and my team took in other to accomplish this task
1) Design and implement the UI
2) Add a timer functionality
3) Add the functionality to snooze the alarm
4) Play a sound when the alarm time has reached
5) Add the functionality to add more alarms

We couldn't finish all of this because of time constraint has we had problem implementing number 5 but we were able to implement the rest. 

We all had a lot of thought process in making the javascript work but we were able to see it through to the end. One of the few things we implement was using the latest features from ES6.
